= Building System Images for Red Hat Device Edge with Image Mode for RHEL
:navtitle: Home

== Goal

This course teaches how to create Red Hat Device Edge system images, which are suitable to provision edge devices and kiosk computers, using image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Liunux (RHEL), and how to publish those images on an Open Container Initiative (OCI) container registry.

It is the first in a series of quick courses about using image mode for RHEL with Red Hat Device Edge, which will consist of three courses:

. *Building System Images for Red Hat Device Edge with Image Mode for RHEL* (this course)

. Provisioning Red Hat Device Edge Systems with Image Mode for RHEL (not created yet)

. Updating and Repurposing Red Hat Device Edge Systems with Image Mode for RHEL (not created yet)

IMPORTANT: Red Hat employees must enroll using its https://training-lms.redhat.com/sso/saml/auth/rhlpint?RelayState=deeplinkoffering%3D84937026[Red Hat University] entry, and Red Hat Partners must enroll using its https://training-lms.redhat.com/sso/saml/auth/rhopen?RelayState=deeplinkoffering%3D84937349[Red Hat Partner Connect] entry.

== Objectives

On completing this course, you should be able to:

* Understand the usage of image mode for RHEL on Red Hat Device Edge systems.
* Build system images for edge devices using image mode for RHEL.
* Test and validate system images for edge devices using local virtual machines (VM)s.
* Publish system images for edge devices in an OCI container registry.

== Audience

Operations-focused customer roles, who design and implement sustem images for edge devices, but are not usually in-person at edge sites:

* System Administrators (IT - Information Technology, and OT - Operations Technology)
* Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
* Platform Engineers
* DevOps Engineers

Red Hat and Partner roles that perform demonstrations, PoC and PoV of Red Hat Device Edge as part of a sales motion, such as Solutions Architects

Red Hat and Partner roles that support customers of Red Hat Device Edge, such as Services Consultants and Customer Support Engineers.

== Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have the following experience:

* Familiarity with RHEL system administration, to the level of RHCA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) or equivalent knowledge.
* Familiarity with Linux container tools, such as Podman, and technologies compatible with OCI specifications, such as container registries.
* Familiarity with web server administration, such as Apache Web Server or NGinx, is useful but not required.
* Familiarity with database server administration, such as MariaDB or PostgreSQL, is useful but not required.

== Classroom Environment

You can perform all activities in this course using the virtual classroom lab from *HOL019: Image Mode with RedÂ Hat Device Edge Quick Course Series*, which is shared by all quick courses about image mode with Red Hat Device Edge and will be updated as required for future related courses.

Use the following links to access the virtual classroom lab on Red Hat Online Learning (ROLE):

* https://role.rhu.redhat.com/rol-rhu/app/courses/hol019-10.0/[HOL019 for Red Hat employees^].
* HOL019 for Red Hat partners [SOON!]
* https://rol.redhat.com/rol/app/courses/hol019-10.0/[HOL019 for Red Hat customers^] with a *Red Hat Learning Subscription*.

WARNING: The classroom environment will be made available at course release time.

After you enter HOL019 on ROLE, follow the instructions there to create a new course classroom lab and access its virtual machines.
If you already created a HOL019 classroom for another Red Hat Device Edge quick course, you can continue using the same classroom lab.

Beware that ROLE classrooms have timers after which classroom labs are stopped and deleted, to conserve compute resources.
If you plan to use the same classroom lab for multiple Red Hat Device Edge quick courses, do not wait too long to continue.

You do not need to use the same classroom for multiple courses: each course provides step-by-step instructions to start from either a new classroom lab or to continue from an existing classroom lab.

You will follow this quick course by alternating between two browser windows: one to navigate quick course materials, such as this page; and another to access the virtual classroom lab, to perform hands-on activities.

If you can provision your own RHEL servers or VMs, it should be possible to configure all that is required for the hands-on activities by using a https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download[free subscription^] from the https://developers.redhat.com/about[Red Hat Developer Program^], which gives access to RHEL installation media and RHEL package repositories.

== About Red Hat Online Learning (ROLE) and Red Hat Learning Subscription

The Red Hat Online Learning (ROLE) website provides https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training-and-certification[Red Hat Training and Certification^] course materials and their virtual classrooms labs.
You must be enrolled in a Red Hat Training course or subscription to have access to ROLE.

NOTE: The image mode with Red Hat Device Edge quick courses use ROLE for its virtual classroom labs only, and hosts courses materials outside of ROLE, as GitHub pages.

A basic https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription[Red Hat Learning Subscription^] offers access to a number of Red Hat Training courses and virtual classroom lab time. Higher subscription tiers offer additional benefits such as Red Hat Certification Exam vouchers.
