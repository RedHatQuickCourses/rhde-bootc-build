= Build Bootc Containers With Podman

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::
Build system images for edge devices using Podman

WARNING: Not Started

== PROVISORY OUTLINE

* Bootc container images are NOT bootable and are NOT intended to be executed in a container.
* Bootc base images vs bootc derived images.
* Filesystem layout with composefs. Unlike rpm-ostree, you can install packages and binaries in /opt and /usr/local, as long as you donâ€™t write data on these folders (write on /var or create symlinks to /var)
* Containerfiles for bootc images vs Containerfiles for application images
* Reproducible builds?

== Bootc Containers Versus Application Containers

== What's Next

The next activity builds a simple bootc container image and performs early testing of those images using Linux containers, to demonstrate the need for system testing in addition to container testing of bootc container images.
